## Quantitative property/condition

### Property : PRO

##### NN, NP, or JJ

Definition (i): anything that can have a unit and a value, e.g., conductivity, band gap, or quantities based on many
values e.g., band structure. Does not included conditions such as temperature, or sample specific properties such as
thickness.

i. "We measured the `electron mobility` of GaN to be 10 cm$^2$/Vs" (NP)

ii. The `band gap` of ZnO is 3.4 eV (NP)

iii. We calculated the `band structure` using tight binding (NP)

Definition (ii): Any qualitative property or phenomenon exhibited by a material that does not have a unit, e.g.,
ferroelectricity, metallic.

i. BaTiO3 exhibits `ferroelectricity` (NN)

ii. We studied `metallic` Ge nanowires   (in this case JJ)

Definition (iii): Any measureable spectra, e.g., absorption spectrum, phonon dispersion curve.

Properties that include another species, e.g., adsorption isotherm, band offset, or, properties that depend on a
device, e.g., leakage current, are not materials properties, but will be included to improve the NLP models.
