##### Material of interest

###### Part of speech: NN, NP, JJ

Any inorganic solid or alloy, any non-gaseous element (at RT), e.g., BaTiO3, FeNi, Fe. For single elements, only tag as MAT if the mention refers to the solid-state phase of the material; e.g., Ni being mentioned as a catalyst; on the otherhand for Si-doped GaN, Si will not be tagged as CHM not MAT.

i. This study focuses on (`BaTiO3`, NN) thin films

ii. The aspect ratio of the (`carbon nanotubes`, NP) (not strictly inorganic, but we make an exception for carbon)

iii. The (`Ni`, JJ) catalyst had high effieciency.

If it is a mixture of materials, make sure to annotate hyphens and slashes, so it is treated as a single entity. If it is a heterostructure, i.e. materials are not mixed, annotated them as separate materials.

iv. Fabrication and characterization of (`B2O3–Al2O3–Na2O`, NN) glass system.

v. (`GaN` / `ZnO`, NN, NN) heterostructure was used for LEDs.
