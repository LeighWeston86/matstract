### Material of interest : MAT

##### NN, NP, JJ

Any inorganic solid or alloy, any non-gaseous element (at RT), e.g., BaTiO3, FeNi, Fe. For single elements, only tag as MAT if the mention refers to the solid-state phase of the material; e.g., Ni being mentioned as a catalyst; on the otherhand for Si-doped GaN, Si will not be tagged as CHM not MAT.

i. `BaTiO3` (NN)

ii. `Carbon nanotube` (NP) (not strictly inorganic, but we make an exception for carbon)

iii. The `Ni` catalyst had high effieciency (JJ).
