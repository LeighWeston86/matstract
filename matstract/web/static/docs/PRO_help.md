##### Property

###### Part of speech: NN, NP, or JJ

Definition (i): anything that can have a unit and a value, e.g., conductivity, band gap, or quantities based on many
values e.g., band structure. Does not included conditions such as temperature, or sample specific properties such as
thickness. Does not have to be a property of a material, can be a property of a reaction. This will be taken care of later by relation annotation.

i. "We measured the (`electron mobility`, NP) of GaN to be 10 cm$^2$/Vs"

ii. The (`band gap`, NP) of ZnO is 3.4 eV

iii. We calculated the (`band structure`, NP) using tight binding

iv. The (`yield`, NN) of the reaction was 80%.

&nbsp;

Definition (ii): Any binary qualitative property or phenomenon exhibited by a material that does not have a unit, e.g.,
ferroelectricity, metallic.

i. BaTiO3 exhibits (`ferroelectricity`, NN)

ii. We studied (`metallic`, JJ) Ge nanowires

&nbsp;

Definition (iii): Any measureable spectra, e.g., absorption spectrum, phonon dispersion curve

Properties that include another species, e.g., adsorption isotherm, band offset, or, properties that depend on a
device, e.g., leakage current, are not materials properties, but will be included to improve the NLP models.
