##### Descriptor for material

###### Part of speech: VB, JJ, NN, NP

Special descriptions of the shape/type for the material/chemical mention. Examples are nanowire, quantum dot, dopant, ion.

i. Silicon (`doped`, VB) ZnO (`nanowires`, NN)

ii. (`Thin film`, NN) BaTiO3 was deposited

iii. (`amorphous`, JJ) and (`crystalline`, JJ) ZnO

iv. BeH2 (`foam`, NN)

v. PbO - based (`glass`, NN)

vi. We made a (`ceramic`, JJ) film.

&nbsp;

This has to be a modifier for the material, and not a standalone reference to the material.

*Poisitive example:* We sputterd Co (`thin films`, NN).

*Negative example:* The **thin films** had a high conductivity. (here, thin films is a sample reference)
