##### Descriptor for sample

###### Part of speech: VB, JJ, NN, NP

Special descriptions of the shape/type for the sample. The vast majority of the cases this will be a **structural descriptor** of the material/species. Do not confuse this with property/quality. Examples are nanowire, quantum dot, dopant. Do not annotate ion, atom, etc., because these are descriptors for chemical mentions and not materials of interest.

ii. (`Thin film`, NN) BaTiO3 was deposited

iii. (`amorphous`, JJ) and (`crystalline`, JJ) ZnO

iv. BeH2 (`foam`, NN)

v. PbO - based (`glass`, NN)

vi. We made a (`ceramic`, JJ) film.

vii. (`thin films`, NN) of NiO.

&nbsp;

This has to be a modifier for the material, and not a standalone reference to the material.

*Poisitive example:* We sputterd Co (`thin films`, NN).

*Negative example:* The **thin films** had a high conductivity. (here, thin films is a sample reference)
