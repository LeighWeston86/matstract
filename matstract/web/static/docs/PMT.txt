### Post-processing/treatment technique : PMT

##### NN, JJ, VB, NP

Any technique used to modify a sample post-synthesis.

i. Materials were treated via `annealing` (NN)

ii. Materials were `annealed` at high temperature (VB)

iii. The `annealed` samples were then cooled via a rapid quenching technique (JJ)
