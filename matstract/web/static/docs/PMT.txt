### Post-processing/treatment technique : PMT

##### NN, JJ, VB, NP

Any technique used to modify a sample post-synthesis.

i. Materials were treated via (`annealing`, NN)

ii. Materials were (`annealed`, VB) at high temperature

iii. The (`annealed`, JJ) samples were then cooled via a rapid quenching technique
