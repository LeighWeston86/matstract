### Structure/phase label : SPL

#####  JJ

Names for crystal structures, e.g., tetragonal, zinc blende, fcc, or any symmetry label Pbnm, Pnma
(can google any if unsure). Note that this is only for specific crystal structures, i.e., orhtorhomic is ok,
perovskite is not. Amorphous is not a crystal structure.

i. In the ground state BN is `hexagonal` (JJ)

ii. The perovskite SrZrO3 has an `orthorhombic` crystal structure with `Pbnm` symmetry (JJ, JJ)
