###### Part of speech: NN,  NP

Any method for used ot characterize a material, experiment or theory: e.g., photoluminescence, XRD, tight binding theory, DFT. 

i. We studied the microstructure using `scanning electron microscopy` (NP)

ii. We calculate the band structure using the `tight binding` approximation (NP)
